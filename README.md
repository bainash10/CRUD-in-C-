# Student Records Management System (C++)

This program implements basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records stored in a text file (`students.txt`). Users interact with student data through a menu-driven interface using C++ standard input/output and file handling functionalities.

## Features

- **Create Record**: Append new student records (name and age) to `students.txt`.
- **Display Records**: Read and display all student records stored in `students.txt`.
- **Update Record**: Update a student's age based on their name.
- **Delete Record**: Remove a student record from `students.txt` by name.

## File Structure

- `main.cpp`: Source code file containing the main program logic.
- `students.txt`: Text file used to store student records.

## Note

- Ensure `students.txt` exists in the same directory as the compiled program.
- Modify the file paths or names as per your system configuration.
